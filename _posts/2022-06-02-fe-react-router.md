- React Router
- User log in
- Using local storage with state to store an auth token

## 🎯 Project

You should have detailed wireframes and a user flow outline by now, and components for at least the initial "page" your user is going to see when they arrive at your site. By tomorrow, you should be able to make requests for questions and answers. Deploy to Netlify as soon as possible (💡 Your code needs to run locally with no errors before you can deploy it).

## 📖 Read | 📺 Watch | 🎧 Listen

⚠️ These two resources are for **older versions of React Router**, so you will see some **outdated syntax**. For instance `Switch`, `Redirect`, and the `component` prop on `Route` exist only in versions of React Router earlier than version 6. However, the main concepts are the same, so these resources can still help you understand the context and usage of React Router.
