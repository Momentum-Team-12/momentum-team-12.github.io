## 🗓️ Today's Topics

- Troubleshooting AJAX requests and getting data on the page
- Using multiple components and conditional rendering to create multiple views of your application

## 🎯 Project

Continue React Trivia. Remember to take it step by step! Don't try to do too much at once.

For Thursday, make your trivia categories selectable. When selected, you should show at least 10 questions for that category.

If you can get that working, the next step is to show a single question with answer choices. After that you can make the answer choices selectable.

- [PropTypes in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) - This came up in class today so here's some more info. Checking types for props is especially useful as your application grows, but it's ok to leave them out for now while you're still learning React. (There's a section at the bottom for how to use them with function components.)
