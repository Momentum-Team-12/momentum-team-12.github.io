## 🗓️ Today's Topics

- Troubleshooting AJAX requests and getting data on the page
- Using multiple components and conditional rendering to create multiple views of your application

## 🎯 Project

Continue React Trivia. Remember to take it step by step! Don't try to do too much at once.

For Thursday, make your trivia categories selectable. When selected, you should show at least 10 questions for that category.

If you can get that working, the next step is to show a single question with answer choices. After that you can make the answer choices selectable.
